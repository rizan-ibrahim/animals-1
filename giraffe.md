giraffe, (genus Giraffa), any of four species in the genus Giraffa of 
long-necked cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with long legs and a 
coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background. Giraffes 
are the tallest of all land animals; males (bulls) may exceed 5.5 metres 
(18 feet) in height, and the tallest females (cows) are about 4.5 metres. 
Using prehensile tongues almost half a metre long, they are able to browse 
foliage almost six metres from the ground. Giraffes are a common sight in 
grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, where they can be seen in 
reserves such as Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park and Kenya’s Amboseli 
National Park.
