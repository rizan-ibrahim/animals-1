There are approximately 356 species of turtles living on land in all 
continents except Antarctica and in both salt water and fresh water. 
Tortoises (family Testudinidae) live exclusively on land and have anatomic 
features distinguishing them from other turtles, but the term tortoise has 
long been used to refer to other terrestrial testudines as well, such as 
the box turtle and the wood turtle. Similarly, terrapin was sometimes used 
to describe any aquatic turtle but is now largely restricted to the edible 
diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) of the eastern United States.
