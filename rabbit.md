Rabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert 
to tropical forest and wetland. Their natural geographic range in the 
Western Hemisphere encompasses the middle latitudes. In the Eastern 
Hemisphere rabbits are found in Europe, portions of Central and Southern 
Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra, and Japan. The European rabbit 
(Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been introduced to many locations around the 
world, and all breeds of domestic rabbit originate from the European.
